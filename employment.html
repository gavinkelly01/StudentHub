      <h2>Balancing college and a job.</h2>
      <p>Attending college can be very expensive with most college tuition fees costing up to €3000. while there are many student that are entitled to grants there are many that are not and therefore a part-time job is necessary.</p>

      <h3>Here are some tips to balance the college and job lifestyle. </h3>
      <h4>1.prioritize and plan</h4>
      <p>Make a planner. Have a planner containing your work hours and your classes. with this you can make dedicated study times during the week. It is also important to add deadlines to the planner to ensure that you will not fall behind schedule. </p>
    <p>It is also useful to set prioritizes to determine what tasks are most important to tackle first. for example if there is an assignment that is due in a week and one that is due in 2 weeks the one that is due in a week should have higher priority.</p>
<h4>2.Communicate with Employers. </h4>
      <P>Let your employers know that you are in college and are not available for the entire week. share the times that you are available to work with your employers so that your college and study times do not overlap with work. Ask for weekend days off from time to time, this will be a nice break in the weekend that you can use to relax or to study.</P>
    <h3>3.Take care of yourself.</h3>
      <P>We know that it can be very hard to look after yourself when you are so busy, however it is very important or else you will burn yourself out. You should aim to have 7-8 hours of sleep each night, maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly this can be going to the gym or even getting out and going for a walk.</P>
