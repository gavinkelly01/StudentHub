  <h2>It's important! Don't neglect it before it's too late.</h2>
  <h3>Why is your mental health important?</h3>
  <p>Your mood is entirely dependent on your mental health, without good mental health, your mood is low, your energy isn't there and life almost becomes a chore.
  Mental health dictates everything you feel, be it your mood, how you react to things or just how you go about your day, your mental health dictates it all.
  <h3>What can affect your mental health</h3>
  <p>Really everything can, from experiences you've been through, to day-to-day life, to really anything that affects your emotions.
  Specifically for college students, the stress of the academic year and the pressure that comes with it can do a lot to negatively affect mental health.
  From exam stress, to assignment deadlines and just the constant pressure of college is the largest cause of mental health problems amongst college students,
  aswell as that, for many college students who are just becoming adults, substances and events where the comsumption of alcohol and other substances are done can be frequent, this can also lead to a downturn in mental health due to the affects those substances can have on your body and brain.
  Adversly, college students have many ways to improve their mental health, colleges offer many social events and options, socialising can vastly improve mental health and help alleviate the pressure put on by academics.
  Social life, time away from work and breaks in general can do a lot for someone's mental health, allowing for time for one's brain to rest and recupierate, allieviating stress and anxiety from someone's mental state.</p>
