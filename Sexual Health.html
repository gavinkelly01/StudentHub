<h1>Sexual Health.</h1>
<h2>Keep yourself informed! It might save you.</h2>
<p>During college, sexual acts and interests become more common and more frequent for many people, as such, and equally, the risks also grow.
  STI's, pregnancy and issues caused by sex also become more frequent, we will cover this along with ways to combat them.</p>

<h2>Sexually Transmitted Infections</h2>
<p>STIs are infections and sometimes diseases that are transmitted through sexual acts, mainly intercourse.
  <br>
STIs, which can inevitably become STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) are caused by the transfer of infections, bacteria or parasites from one person to another through blood, semen or other bodily fluids.
  </br>
  <br>
These infections can have seriously negative impacts on a person's health, for men and women both it can cause infertility, cancers, and the created risk of HIV, and specifically for women can cause issues with pregnancy.
  </br>
  <br>
There are many signs of an STI, in men it can be lumps or sores on their genitals, for women it could be irregularly times bleeding that is not part of the menstrual cycle, for both it can cause a burning sensation when peeing, pain during sex and odours along with discharge from the genitals.
  </br>
  <br>
<strong>There are many kinds of STIs, ranging from treatable and cureable to lifelong and incurable.</strong>
  </br>
  <br>
On the more treatable side there is something like Chlamydia, a common STI that can be treated and easily cured with medicine.
  </br>
On the other side, and most dangerous is Human Immunodeficiency Virus, also known as HIV or AIDS, which is a virus that jumped from chimpanzees to humans in the 20th century, it is treatable, but incurable.
It is a disease that is spread through unprotected anal sex with an infected person, the sharing of needles and the shooting of ilicit drugs, it is the most dangerous STI and still kills around 630,000 people worldwide a year.
</p>

<h3>How do I protect myself from an STI? And how can I help myself if I get one?</h3>
<p>Thankfully, there are many ways to protect yourself from STIs.
  <br>
The easiest way is the use of a condom, it protects the penis from infections and also protects the chances of pregnancy if unwanted.
  </br>
  <br>
There can still be cases of it being unsuccessful, so when using a condom, especially with somebody infected with a virus, always remember there is some kind of risk.
  </br>
  <br>
Now, if you have found out that you have an STI, it is not the end of your life, like previously mentioned, there are many ways to combat and treat most STIs and STDs,
the likes of Syphilis, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, while hard to deal with, are treatable and inevitably curable, and with those being the most common, are able to be-dealt with well.
  </br>
Unfortunately there are four STDs that are not curable, HIV, Hepatitis B, herpes and human papillomavirus, now, in comparison to the other three, herpes is rarely life-threatening and can in come cases eventually go away.
But the other three are incurable and must be taken with caution and care to treat, it doesn't necessarily mean death, life changes must be made to combat what is happening to your body.
</p>

<h2>Pregnancy</h2>
<p>Pregnancy is a common part of life, and in college, can happen a lot due to factors such as alcohol or lack of contraception.
  <br>
Sex is quite a common part of college life, most people are aged between 18-22, and are discovering sex, alcohol, drugs and because of that, decisions made without critical thinking happen and pregnancies can occur.
  </br>
  <br>
Now, if a woman gets pregnant, it is not a be all end all, 50 years ago it may have been but in the modern world, abortion is legal in many places and women can choose whether they wish to keep the embryo to grow into a child or not.
  </br>
Regardless, a woman's life alters greatly by getting pregnant, especially at a relatively young age, mentally and physically it is gruelling, choosing to keep the baby or not atop college stress can cause major mental issues, and choosing to keep the baby causes many physical issues for at least the next nine months.
</p>

<h3>I want to have sex but don't want to get pregnant, what can I do?</h3>
<p>Contraception is key. Birth control in any form is crucial for anybody wishing to have sex but not wanting to have children.
  <br>
A commonly used method, and one of the most effective methods is a birth control pill, this pill protects a woman from getting pregnant.
  </br>
  <br>
Now, there are two mainly used types of birth control pills, the combination birth control pills, and the minipill.
  </br>
  <br>
Combination pill: The combination pill is a pill that contains both estrogen and progestin, what this pill does is it stops a woman from ovulating, which means an egg cannot be released from the ovaries.
It also causes changes to the mucus in the opening of the uterus, which is called the cervix, and to the lining of the uterus, which is called the endometrium. These changes keep sperm from joining the egg.
  </br>
  <br>
Minipill: This pill thickens cervical mucus and thins the lining of the uterus.
This prevents sperm from reaching the egg and a fertilized egg from being implanted into a womans womb to begin the pregnancy.
This all seems great, and it is, but birth control pills come with many side effects, due to the estrogen and progestin in the pill, a womans hormones can shift and change due the estrogen levels in your body changing.
  </br>
Most prevalently, these side effects include mood swings, potential weight gain and in the early stages, headaches, sore breasts and some bleeding between periods, along with a change in sex drive, often a decrease.
These effects can hinder some women from wanting to go on the pill, but due to its effectiveness many women take it anyways.
</p>
<h3>There are other ways though!</h3>
  <br>
<p>There are other ways to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancies, external contraception such as condoms are the most commonly used but due to there being a small chance of them not working, other methods are sought after.
  </br>
  <br>
One method that has become more popular in the modern world is an IUD (intrauterine device). An IUD is a small T-shaped coil containing copper thread, instead of hormones it releases copper that immobilize sperm and stop them from fertilizing the egg, it is implanted into the cervix to allow for this to take place.
Conversly, there is an IUD that can be implanted into the arm, called the long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC, instead of copper it releases progestin slowly into the body to stop pregnancy.
  </br>
  <br>
While IUDs are very effective, unlike external contraception they do not protect from STI's or STD's, so that risk needs to be accounted for.
  </br>
Finally, there is emergency contraception, the most common being the morning after pill, how the pill works is it delays the release of an egg from your ovary until sperm are no longer active inside the vagina, protecting from pregnancy.
</p>
<h2>I got pregnant and don't wish to keep the baby, what can I do?</h2>
<p>Should this happen, immediately contact your doctor and speak with them,
there are multiple options but the most common is abortion, unfortunately in some places abortion is not legal and this causes a problem, thankfully in Ireland, since 2018 it is legal to abort a pregnancy in the first trimester of said pregnancy.
</p>

<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>Sex is an action that is supposed to be enjoyable and pleasureable for all involved, this only happens if all parties consent, without consent, anybody who has not consented has been sexually assaulted.
Consent can be given and taken away too, if you gave consent but then midway through you don't wish to continue, that is okay too, sex should only be enacted if all parties are enhjoying and want it.
There are things to remember:
  <br>
1.Intoxicated people cannot give consent. If somebody gives consent but are intoxicated beyond rational thinking, that is not proper consent, if the other party is also that level of intoxicated it is a mutual act and there is no fault but if one party is sober, they are in the wrong and have committed sexual assault.
  </br>
  <br>
2.Minors cannot give consent. Even before that, if anybody who is a minor is being spoken to by an adult in a sexual fashion, step in or notify authorities, that is a crime, and minors in no way can give consent to enact sexual acts with adults.
  </br>
  <br>
3.Saying yes does not mean you cannot say no later. As mentioned, consent can be revoked if one party is no longer enjoying the sex or no longer wants to take part, if another party continues regardless, that is sexual assault and rape and should be reported to authorities.
  </br>
  <br>
If you have been the victim of rape or sexual assault, please contact authorities, many people have stories about being assaulted and have a hard time speaking up about it, if that is you, please get in touch with a professional to work through the trauma, and alert authorities so they know the names of people who have committed sexual assault.
  </br>
  <br>
There are many things people have been told to excuse others of sexual assault, like "what were you wearing" or "did you enjoy it". These are not excuses. Anybody who has had sex without the other parties full consent is a sexual offender and liable for prosecution by authorities.
  </br>
<strong>NOTE! The legal age of consent changes in many countries, in Ireland it is 17, if you are a student from abroad please ensure you understand and follow this, otherwise you will be prosecuted for sexual misconduct with a minor.</strong>
