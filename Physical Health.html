  <h1>Physical Health</h1>
  <h2>The harder you work the better you feel!</h2>
<p>Your physical health determines a lot, it determines your energy, your strength, speed and all sorts, but it also determines your fitness on the inside, namely lungs and heart.
  <br>
Keeping physically fit does a lot for your overall health and wellness, as well as helping things like strength, stamina and self-image. Being in good physical shape can also help if somebody comes down with illness,
illnesses attack the body, so your body being in good shape means when the attack comes, your body is able to fight the illnesses off in a more effective manner to if you were in poor physical condition.
  </br>
</p>
  <h3>How can you keep your physical health in shape?</h3>
<p>There are many ways you can keep your health in check, with ways for anybody to keep up, regardless of most circumstances.
1. Dieting: Dieting is the easiest way to lose weight, as you can do it without having to work, dieting is all about restraint, keeping to a kind of food schedule.
  <br>
  It all comes down to calories, the calories you intake directly relate to how much weight you gain and lose, losing weight can be done through something as small as cutting down on food with fats and sugars, to going into what is called a "calorie deficit" which is where you have less calories than you would burn in a day.
  </br>
  <br>
On the other side, being underweight is as bad as being overweight, so it would be the opposite for someone in that scenario, they would want to be consuming more calories to build up fat that can be turned into muscle or cut back down to be at a particular weight that person wants to be at.
  </br>
  <br>
Some caloric food includes bread, red meat, chocolate, and any food containing a lot of butter or oils.
On the other side food like white meat, rice, fish and vegetables are foods with very low calorie count. The amount of calories somebody should intake is all dependent on their height and weight, so somebody who is 6"2 and 90kg needs to take in more calories than somebody who is 5"7 and 65kg.
  </br>
Your body mass index or BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, using BMI calculators you can enter in your height and weight and get your BMI back, finding out if at your current weight if you are over, under or at the correct weight for your height.
In all, dieting is very crucial for gaining or losing weight, but isn't about starving or gorging yourself on food, moderation is key and can lead to an increase in physical fitness and overall health.

  <p>These foods are the usual to go for when trying to eat balanced and healthily.</p>
<p>2. Working out: Working out is the best way to build muscle, lose weight and mold your body into the shape you want it to be, working out is a broad term that encompasses a lot of different exercises, from going to the gym, running, swimming or really any kind of activity that is under the term of exercise.
  <br>
Working your body, in particular your muscles is the best way to burn calories and shape your body based on how you want it to look, at base level, working out burns the calories you intake and builds muscle throughout your body, but when going a more specific route, can build muscle in specific places more than the rest of your body.
  </br>
  <br>
For example, weightlifters prioritise the arms, legs, chest and back to be able to lift and hold more weight when working out, whereas people who do calisthenics work primarily the core to be able to hold the body in place when doing workouts, using their weight as resistance to be able to complete movements otherwise undoable,
there are also workout types that focus on endurance like running or cycling that builds up stamina, which people build to be able to complete activities like marathons or triathalons.
  </br>
There are so many ways to work out and build your body in a way you would like, but what they all share is that they help keep you healthy physically.
  <br>
  <strong>If you want to find out your BMI, use this link to head over to a BMI calculator: <a href=https://www.calculator.net/bmi-calculator.html>BMI</a></strong>
  </br>
</p>
  <h3>I'm a college student, how can I find the time?</h3>
<p>Working out or dieting does not have to be a time-consuming, rigid part of your day that takes away time from your studies or assignments, as a college student, time can often be short and precious, so there are ways to keep up your physical health even on a time limit.
  <br>
Working out doesn't need to be an hour or more long workout session, 30-40 minutes is enough if you take short breaks between sets, or push to failure, since once failure upon a set is achieved, any workouts afterward do less good than bad.
  </br>
  <br>
As well as that, you don't need to even go to the gym to work out, if you're short on time, home workouts, whether a core workout or if you have some weights at home can entirely suffice.
  </br>
In terms of dieting, it is a lot easier than it may sound, dieting is as simple as setting yourself a specific diet and keeping to it throughout your day, you don't have to go out of your way to keep up a diet, so as a college student, you can keep a diet up while still prioritising studies, assignments etc.
