    <h2>What is cost of living</h2>
    <p>The cost of living is the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes, transport and household supplies. The cost of these essentials changes over time and in recent years has increased.</p><p>The term "cost of living" is used to compare how expensive it is to live in one city to abother. For example it is more expensive to live in Dublin than it is in Wicklow. As the cost of living is higher in Dublin the salary needs to be higher.   </p>
<h2>The cost of living crisis</h2>
<p>The cost of living crisis refers to an economic trend that began in 2021, where prices have been increasing more rapidly than wages. When prices rise faster than wages, the average consumer's purchasing power decreases, meaning they cannot afford as much as they used to. This phenomenon, known as inflation, reached levels in 2021 and 2022 not seen globally since the 1980s. The primary driver of this inflation was rising energy costs, which in turn increased the prices of other goods and services.

  When inflation occurs without corresponding wage increases, people's earnings lose value, making it harder for those already facing economic challenges to afford their living expenses. A 2022 poll commissioned by the National Youth Council of Ireland found that seven out of ten young people were considering emigration due to concerns about how the cost of living in Ireland would affect their quality of life.</p>
<h2>Tips for saving money</h2>
    <p>The cost of living crisis is making is very hard for us to save up any money here are a few tips that can save you money.<br></p>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>When attending college it can be very tempting to eat out or to order a takeaway. Eating out every day is going to be very expensive. We highly recommend that you cook your own food at home. Reasearch supermarkets near you and find out which one is the best value, plan what meal you are going to make before going to the shop and get the items required.<br>Bring your own lunche to college. This is very simple and will save you a lot of money each week. By buying some grocies each week such as a sliced pan and sandwich filling you will be able to bring sandwiches into college. For example to buy a ready-made sandwich in the shop cost €5 compared to a sliced pan (€1) and sandwich filling (€4). buying the ingredients yourself will save you €15 a week.  </p>
  <h3>Social life</h3>
    <p>Being a sensible budgeter doesn’t mean you can’t have fun. By creating a planned budget, you can allocate funds for dining out, coffee dates, cinema trips, and nights out without worrying about overspending.</p>

    <p>Don’t hesitate to ask for a student discount. Look out for student deals that can make your social life more affordable. Your student ID card can be handy for discounts at clothing stores, hairdressers, and other retailers. Joining college societies often provides cards that offer discounts at certain restaurants and shops, such as two-for-one main courses at Wagamama.</p>

    <p>Many cinemas have student days with reduced ticket prices or deals that include popcorn. For example, Odeon cinemas offer €6 tickets every Wednesday.</p>

    <p>Nightclubs frequently have student nights or special deal nights, and many places offer free entry before 11 pm.</p>

    <p>When going out, decide in advance how much money you want to spend and remember to budget for getting home, whether by taxi or night bus. Sharing a taxi with friends can help keep costs down for everyone. If you’re worried about sticking to your budget, bring only the amount of cash you plan to spend and leave your card safely at home.</p>

    <p>Managing your money can be challenging, but planning your spending will help you avoid financial tight spots.</p>
