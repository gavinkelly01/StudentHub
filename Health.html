<h2>Focus on your health! With these tips.</h2>
<p>We know that being a college student can take up every moment of your time, and because of that, your health may take a dive, both physically and mentally.
To combat this, we have some tips to help you with keeping up with your health.

<h3>Keep your mental health positive!</h3>
Exam stress, the pressure of assignments and life in general during the college year can do a lot of harm to someone's mental health.
These easy tips can help you with the day-to-day stresses.
1. Breaks: Deadlines and assignment build-up make the idea of breaks seem unnecessary and like they aren't needed, but taking breaks are a necessity to prevent burnout and exhaustion.
2. Hobbies: It sounds trivial, but having something you enjoy to break away from the constant of doing coursework can do wonders on someone's mental health, offering a break and enjoyment.
3. Meditation: A bit of a broad term, but anything that can put one out of the mindset of work, work, work and into a more relaxed and calm mindset can help someone under stress to a major degree.
If the struggles somebody is having mentally is beyond something like exam stress, and is a serious mental concern
whether that be struggling with anxiety, depression or major stress that exam stress has added to. It is imperative that someone prioritises their health over their work
if you are struggling with mental health issues that you don't believe can be solved with breaks or some time away from your work.
Please use some of these resources to get in touch with someone who can help and listen, you are not alone, there are helplines out there.
Alternatively, your college will have services there for you, if you feel it would be better to speak on your struggles with someone close physically, please contact them through your particular colleges website.

<h3>Protect your physical health.</h3>
Just like your mental health, your physical health can take a downturn due to college work build-up and exams.
But there are plenty of ways to keep your physical health in check and keep yourself fit, such as.
1. Exercise: An obvious one, but any exercise whether it be playing a sport, going to the gym, or just going for a walk, physical exercise of any kind can keep you fit and fresh as you navigate busy times during exam season.
2. Diet: Again, obvious but especially during times of stress, we all tend to just eat and drink anything in front of us regardless of nutrition,
to combat this, keeping to some kind of diet can go a long way in keeping physically well, which in turn will make you feel better when studying etc.
3. Schedules: It sounds odd but giving yourself a schedule where you have specific times to go and do physical exercise or go for a walk or whatever
you want to do can really make it easier to keep it up in terms of keeping physically fit.

<h3>Your sexual health is important too!</h3>
Similar to your mental and physical health, your sexual health is as important, as you enter adulthood and are surrounded by other young adults in college too, sex becomes a more common part of life.
Because of this STI's, STD'S and other health and life complications come with the introduction of sex, sexual acts and other related terms in your life.
The potential for pregnancy and the unfortunate potential for sexual assault can happen which is a serious, life-changing event.

<h3>Is my health more important than my studies?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, many college students neglect their health, mentally, physically and sexually in the name of their studies, while studies and exams are obviously super important, nothing is more important than your health, it directly impacts everything that goes on in your life and with good health, all aspects of your life improve.
It may at times seem like it is not as important as your studies, but without good health, the toll that college has on someone will be even greater, neglecting mental health wll lead to overwhelming stress and anxiety, and the more it is ignored, the worse it gets.
And physically it may seem daunting to keep yourself in any kind of good physical shape, and to not think about it, but neglecting your body will result in having less energy and motivation to actually study and do work, so keeping fit physically also positively impacts your studies.
